# Pihole setup for DHCP server
# (1) Pihole settings (in pihole API) for DNS must permit all origins
# (2) To DNS resolve host's hostname, container hostname cannot be the same as host's
# (3) The first entry in the host's /etc/hosts must be [ip_address] [hostname] - not 127.0.0.1 etc.
# (4) Set /etc/dhcpcd.conf static domain_name_servers=[ip_address] so the host machine can also use Pihole DNS
